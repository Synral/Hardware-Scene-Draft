Scene Draft:
This scene holds the UNI controller and a button to start the game. To play the game, hit the Start/Stop button and click on the listed buttons at the bottom of the screen in the correct order. Doing it correctly will result in a “WIN” text on the bottom right corner of the screen while being wrong will cause it to say “LOSE”. You can stop the game at any point by clicking the button again, which will hide the game UI at the bottom and result in a “LOSE” screen.

Controls:
Hold right-click and move the mouse to rotate the controller, and left click will cast a ray to show the name of the button you click at the top. The input map takes in mousePosition, mouseDelta, LeftClick, and RightClick of a mouse (required).
